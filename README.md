## Step-by-Step Game Setup Instructions

To begin coding your own games, you need to install some essential tools. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Step 1: Install Python

Python is the programming language we will use. You can download and install Python from the official Python website ðŸ”— python.org/downloads/ . Tick all the boxes while installing the python. After installation, you can check if Python is installed correctly by running a simple version check command in the terminal or command prompt.
